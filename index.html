    <p id = "center"> Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter set in the near future. Players play as one of a set of agents, characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team, with each team having five players on it. Valorant is made by the developers of Riot Games. The events of Valorant take place in a distant future version of Earth, one that follows a mysterious event called First Light. Spanning the entire globe, First Light transformed everything in sight â€“ from developing a new technology called Radianite to creating government administrations. Attacking teams are trying to plant the spike, so defeating all the enemies does mean they win the round. But defending teams can still lose rounds even after killing their opponents if they don't defuse the spike in time. </p>

    <p id = "center"> In this Virtual World there are a few cool things you can do. When you click on the LMB (Left Mouse Button) a bullet will fire. If the bullet collides with either of the RES (Red Enemy Sprites) they will dissapeer from the world because they have died. The bots automatically strafe from left to right on their own in order to avoid the bullets but are no match for your insane aim. The dragons above you are the gods of this world and oversee your acts of service.</p>
